## Advice for Infomedia!

### Migration from JS to TypeScript
It may be possible to do that, but there will be issues with RequireJS define() output to overcome. 
There would still be a benefit though, because you can have strong typing and compile errors etc...
Action: Investigate adding a TypeScript compile phase, perhaps using a gulp build that would run the TypeScript compiler and output a define() module for other code to consume.
